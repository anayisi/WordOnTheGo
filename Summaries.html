        <h3>THE BOOK OF OBADIAH</h3>
        <p>
          The book of Obadiah the Prophet, talks about a vision that was revealed to Him by THE MOST HIGH.
          In the vision he saw the destruction of Edom, the descendants of Essau, Jacob’s brother.
          This downfall was due to the fact that Edom had helped the enemies of Israel to defeat them or stood aloof while they were being destroyed.
          After, foretelling Edoms doom, The Prophet went on to talk about the restoration of Israel.

        <h3>THE BOOK OF RUTH</h3>
        <p>
<p>CHAPTER 1</p>
Chapter one (1) of the book of Ruth talks about a man by name Elimelech. This man was married to Naomi, and together they had two sons Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephratithes from Bethlehem Judah.
Once there was famine, and this man together with his family relocated to Moab. At Moab the man died and his two sons married Moabite women; Orpah and Ruth. In a matter of about ten years, the two sons of Naomi had died, and she was left with her daughters in law. Naomi decided to return to her homeland after some time when she heared the famine was over. She entreated her daughters in law to return to their parents as she also returned to her homeland. To this Orpah returned but Ruth refused, saying; “Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me”. At this Naomi left with Ruth to Bethlehem, where as she was being welcomed as Naomi refused and insisted they reffered to her as Mara meaning bitter.

<p>CHAPTER 2</p>
Chapter two (2) of the book of Ruth talks about a man by name Boaz. He was a wealthy man, from the clan of Elimelech. It was time for harvest when Ruth decided to go into the fields of people and as per the laws of Israel, during harvest u don’t return to pick anything u left behind unhavested, this was done so foreigners, widows and the poor who were without farms could also get something to eat when they visit your field after harvest.
Now, Ruth found herself in the field of Boaz as she moved through the fields of people looking for leftovers. Boaz noticed her, and after enquiring of her origin, instructed that his harvesters intentionally leave some of the crops behind so she can pick them up. When it was time to break from the harvest, Boaz invited Ruth to dine with them and he spoke nicely to her. We get to understand later on from the words of Naomi to Ruth, that Boaz had always been kind to people.

<p>CHAPTER 3</p> 
 Chapter three (3) of the book of Ruth talks about the help Naomi offered to Ruth. Because Ruth had been good to Naomi, she decided to get a get her a home, where she would be well provided for. She asked her to dress neatly and go sleep under the feet of Boaz that night, at the threshing floor (a floor where winnowing was done after harvest). This was done when one was in serious difficulty and needed to be redeemed by a guardian redeemer (one who had the obligation to redeem a relative from difficulty). To this, Ruth obeyed and did as she was told, Boaz in the middle of the night realized that Ruth was lying under his feet. Knowing what that meant, he assured her that he would redeem her. But there was a more close relative who was also a guardian redeemer of the family, it is only when he refused to redeem her that he Boaz could. So he had to seek his concern first before anything else, this he promised to do.
<p>CHAPTER 4</p>
Chapter four (4) of the book of Ruth talks about how Boaz was able to redeem Ruth.
In other to keep his promise to Ruth, Boaz went and had a meeting with the older Guardian Redeemer of their family, and ten elders of the town. After some deliberations, it was agreed that Boaz should go on ahead and redeem the land of Elimelech, and by so doing acquire Ruth as a wife, so as to maintain the name of the dead with his property. To this the ten elders of the town served as witnesses, and further pronounced the blessings of THE MOST HIGH on Boaz and his new gotten wife.
Boaz took Ruth in as his wife and they gave birth to Obed, who fathered Jesse, the father of David. The birth of Obed gave Naomi so much joy, that she took the child in and cared for him.

        <h3>THE BOOK OF JONAH</h3>
        <p>
          <p>CHAPTER 1</p>
Chapter one (1) of the book of Jonah introduces us to a Hebrew man by name Jonah, son of Amittai. He was given an Assignment by THE MOST HIGH, to go to the city of Niniveh and preach against it, for its wickedness had gone up before THE MOST HIGH. The man of GOD, Jonah decided to run away from THE LORD, so instead of heading for Nineveh, he boarded a ship that was bound for Tarshish.
On sea, Jonah found a place below deck, where he had fallen deeply in sleep. THE LORD sent a great wind on the sea, so strong that it threatened to break the ship. Casting lots revealed that Jonah was the cause of the storm. When he was queried on his background, he admitted that he was the cause of the storm, because he was running from THE MOST HIGH, THE CREATOR of the sea and dry land, and that the only way they could stop the storm was to throw him off the ship, this the sailors didn’t want to do, but after several attempts to bring the ship off shore which all proved futile, they threw Jonah off the ship into the sea. THE LORD sent a big fish to swallow Jonah, in whose stomach Jonah spent three days and three nights. 
<p>CHAPTER 2</p>
Chapter two (2) of the book of Jonah was a record of what He went through when he was thrown into the sea. This chapter was written while he was in the stomach of the fish. It was basically a prayer that he made to THE MOST HIGH, to come save him. After his prayer, THE LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah on dry land.
<p>CHAPTER 3</p>
Chapter three (3) of the book of Jonah talks about GOD sending Jonah for the second time to Nineveh, to proclaim the words of THE MOST HIGH. It took Jonah a days journey to get to the city. And because Nineveh was large, it took him three days to pass through, within this three days he proclaimed to the Ninevites “forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown”. When the King heared THE LORD’S message through Jonah, he rose from his throne and put on sackcloth, he then issued a proclamation, instructing the whole nation to fast, from human beings to animals. Their action of remorse was seen by GOD, and he relented on HIS decision to destroy  them.

<p>CHAPTER 4<p>
In Chapter four (4) of this Book, Jonah gets angry at THE LORD for not destroying Nineveh. THE LORD made a tree grow up overnight to provide shade for Jonah as he sat outside the city of Nineveh, waiting for its destruction, this tree made Jonah very comfortable. At nght THE LORD sent a worm to eat up all the leaves of the tree, and he made the sun blaze severely on Jonah’s head during the day. This again got Jonah, it was here that THE LORD made it clear to Jonah that if he is this concerned about a tree that grew overnight and died overnight, how much more HE, GOD shouldn’t be concerned about a city that contains over a hundred and twenty thousand people, who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and also many animals.
