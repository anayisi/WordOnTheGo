        <p>
          <p>DATE; Sunday, 1st May 2022.<br>
THEME; JESUS CHRIST, our Salvation.<br>
SCRIPTURE READINGS; Psalm 30:1-12; Revelation 5:11-14; John 21:1-19<br>

OPENING HYMN; PH 146: 1-5<br>
Prayer<br></p>

<p>DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF THEME (Advance English Dictionary):<br>
JESUS: A Teacher and Prophet born in Bethlehem and active in Nazareth; HIS life and Sermons form the basis for Christianity.<br>
CHRIST: Any expected deliverer.<br>
OUR: Everybody, myself included.<br>
SALVATION: The act of delivering from sin or saving from evil.
    Saving someone or something from harm or an unpleasant situation.<br></p>

<p>CHRISTIAN DEFINITION OF THEME:<br>
JESUS: This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua (JEHOVAH is his help/ JEHOVAH the Saviour), which was originally Hoshea, but changed by Moses into Jehoshua or Joshua(Num. 13:16)(1 Chr. 7:27).
After the exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whence the Greek form Jesus. It was given to our LORD to denote the object of HIS mission, to save(Matt. 1:21).<br>
CHRIST: Anointed. The Greek translation of Hebrew word rendered “Messiah”. The official title of our LORD, occurring 514  times in the New Testament. It denotes that HE was anointed or concecrated to HIS great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest and King of HIS people.<br>
OUR: Everybody, myself included.<br>
SALVATION: This word is used of the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians (Ex. 14:13), and of deliverance generally from evil or danger.
    Redemption of man from the bondage of sin and liability to eternal death, and the conferring on him everlasting happiness. This is the great Salvation. (Heb. 2:1-4)<br></p>

<p>PSALM 30:1-12; [What we were, what we are now, and what we should do (SALVATION)]</p>
:1 –This scripture begins with David praising GOD for saving him and denying his enemies gloat over him.<br>
:2-3 –He then moves on to recount what The LORD had done for him, being on his way to the depths below, he cried for help and GOD restored his life.<br>
:4-5 –Then he admonishes us to remember what GOD has done and give HIM praise regardless the situation, for they’re all temporal.<br>
:6-10 –The situation and case of the Christian, a roller coaster life. One second all seems to be going well, the next second it’s all coming down.<br>
:11-12 –Yet still HE saves when we persist before HIM. And so we must not be silent, we must let all know what HE has done, what HE is doing, and what HE’LL continue to do for us.
This reading draws our attention to the fact that we have been saved, saved from a death which would have been eternal, and this death was well deserving for we had sinned, and the punishment for sin is death and nothing else. It is a great thing GOD has done for us, let us not downplay it, rather in the ups and downs of life, let’s keep our eyes on the salvation we’ve received and be content with that only that we praise HIM and use our lifes as a reflection of HIM who has saved us. The words of GOD through King David.<br>

<p>REVELATION 5:11-14; [What awaits us in the end. (JESUS CHRIST)]</p>
The book of Revelation, a prophecy from the disciple whom CHRIST loved.<br>
:11-12 –The reading begins with the host of HEAVEN singing songs of Praise, to the lamb who was killed. In the song we realize that because of HIS death, HE has become worthy to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory and praise.<br>
:13-14 –The reading ends with everything that has life according the same praise due HIM who sits on the throne to the Lamb. The worship was directed to both.
This reading is a vivid account of what happened when CHRIST was done with HIS mission on Earth, passing through the hands of men, being molested and treated badly for being different and not giving up on HIS mission and who HE was. From the reading, it is clear, that those who remained in the universe were those who were ready to accord worship to THE LORD, whom it is due. We are being reminded never to give up on who we are as Christians, to fight through just like CHRIST did to the very end. It is then and only then will we be rewarded as CHRIST was, and enjoy a proper and purpose-filled life, a life of worship. The words of GOD through John The Beloved.<br>

<p>JOHN 21:1-19; [What do we do with the Salvation we’ve received, what do we do as we wait]</p>
:1-3 –The reading begins with Simon Peter going fishing with six other disciples. This was the period CHRIST had risen and was showing HIMSELF to them and giving final instructions that they may follow. All night they caught nothing.<br>
:4-6 –Until JESUS appeared in the scene and at HIS Word, they couldn’t carry their catch.<br>
:7-8 –Noticing that HE was JESUS, they hurriedly went ashore to meet HIM.<br>
:9-10 –JESUS already had some fish and HE taught them how to catch some and demanded that they bring some to eat.<br>
:11-14 –Within themselves they were convinced that HE was JESUS, they didn’t need any other proof to conclude that HE was JESUS. HE fed them and they ate.<br>
:15-17 –After eating, HE spoke directly to Simon Peter asking HIM for three times to affirm his love to HIM. In all Simon Peter answered in the positive. And to prove his love, he was to shepherd HIS sheep.<br>
:18-19 –HE then spoke figuratively on how Peter would die to glorify GOD.
This reading entails a lot. From the onset, our minds are being drawn to how as Christians we sideline CHRIST in certain things we do. No matter how small they may seem, let’s invite HIM to lead, before we eat, when we are visited by someone, before we leave home, when we return, in all things let’s give HIM the honor of ruling, for when HE sets in, all things are made whole. HE teaches us all things, with HIM we tend to see things from a different point of view and realize that all things are easy.<br> Taking a look at this picture from a different view, there is work to be done, never with our own strength, lest we become failures, but by HIS Strength it shall be well. We are called to continue HIS work of catching men and leading them to CHRIST. We are custodians of HIS Legacy of redeeming Grace, others must also hear of it. With HIM in the lead, we will have a wonderful time, suffering, enjoying and winning souls for HIM. Shepherding them with the HIS love to point of death, where we would glorify GOD.
As we wait for HIS second coming, this is what we are instructed to do. The Words of GOD by John the beloved.<br> AMEN…<br>

        <p>
          <p>DATE; Sunday, 3rd April 2022.<br>
THEME; BUILDING A NEW NATION IN CHRIST.<br>
SCRIPTURE READINGS; Isaiah 43:16-21; Psalm 126:1-6; John 12:1-8<br>

PH 421; 3nn3 na me YESU afa me y)nko.<br>
Prayer<br></p>

<p>DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF THEME (Advance English Dictionary):<br>
Building: The act of constructing something.<br>
Nation:   A politically organized body of people under a single government.<br>
CHRIST:   Any expected Deliverer.<br></p>

<p>CHRISTIAN DEFINITION OF THEME:<br>
Building: As Christians, we start construction from the spiritual realm, when it is established there, then we begin building from the physical realm, where we wrestle with our bodies in other to build.<br>
Nation: The Christian nation is the body of CHRIST. So if we’re talking about building a new nation, then it means we’re going out into the world, to draw men into this Body of CHRIST. And by so doing, create a worldly nation that are a part of The Body of CHRIST.<br>
CHRIST: We know our Messiah to be one, that is JESUS The CHRIST, it is through HIM alone are we reconciled with GOD.<br></p>

<p>ISAIAH 43:16-21; [NEW NATION]</p>
It has always been said, and is still been said, that due to the sins of Adam and Eve the world has been covered up with darkness. 
Darkness comprising different levels of sins, and different levels of uncalled for sufferings. This is the current nation in which we live.<br>
The new nation being built will be void of these sins and suffering. We have to understand that;<br>
1.  :16 it wouldn’t necessarily take our efforts to build, but the love of GOD will build, by our efforts.
Since it is currently a dark world, we’ll need a light factor to lead us through, and differentiate we who are in the new nation from the rest.
It is with this light of differentiation that roads never travelled will be travelled by us, and countries that seem rough in darkness will be made smooth. 
This is the promise of GOD to all who decide to be a part of this new nation. HE has said it, and HE will do it.<br>

2.  :17 This new nation is open but for a period of time, when up, the rest is humiliation and disgrace, they’ll realize how stupid they’ve been for not accepting this new way.
If you have therefore gotten inside, let nothing from the outside draw you back, lest you’ll gnash your teeth, but no results will be yielded by that.<br>

3.  :18-21 In this new nation, it’s all about learning the dos and don’ts there are. Be willing, serious and passionate to realign yourself with the norms that comes with it regardless, it is a gradual process, study to show yourself approved.<br>

<p>PSALM 126:1-6; [BUILDING]</p>
1.  :1-3    The kind of happiness there’ll be when the building is done, the laughter, the joy, the abundant provisions that’ll be made available. Don’t give up on this.<br>

2.  :4    It is when we’re done with our part of work that the LORD will send rain to finish the whole building.
It is never by our works that this new nation is being built, it is due to HIS love for mankind that HE sends rain to complete this works of ours, either than that, we work in vain.<br>

3.  :5-6    Whoever said building was easy.
The work of the mason is not an easy one. What drives him to finish is the joy he gets when the house is completed and looks nice.

So it is with our work as builders of this nation, we are all children of this new light, and have therefore all received seeds to sow, work around and bring in a harvest.

Let’s be guided that it’s not going to be easy, no. But we can’t give up the joy of seeing our harvest because it’s not easy, let the storms hit you as hard as it can, you may fall a couple of times, but keep your gaze fixed on the joy ahead, and work round your seeds to bring in harvest.
You never know, it may even be your lifestyle that’ll draw others in, be cautious.

The field refers to the people outside the barn, we live with them in our communities, workplaces, schools, social media, etc., our seeds are the words we receive from the house of GOD and Bibles on daily basis.

Let’s put in effort, and the FINISHER will send in rain to complete HIS work.<br>

<p>JOHN 12:1-8; [CHRIST]</p>
CHRIST sets in as The LIGHT to lead us in through this dark times. HE should be our main focus, following at all times.
When we are all set to keeping CHRIST as the focus of our lives, the world will become a better place to live, as we wouldn’t have time to do our neighbor evil. Our aim will be to please CHRIST.
Looking at the nature of CHRIST, HE accepted all who came, not sacking any, no matter the level of their sin.
We must follow suit, if we’re willing to build a new nation in CHRIST as we profess we do.<br>
Let’s be spiritually inclined always, seeking to please CHRIST with the little opportunities we get, helping others to also have a feel of HIM, with this we will gradually be creating a new nation that is CHRIST centered, for the world to become a better a place for us all.<br>

<p>Close PH 502; Bere a YEHOWA begye.</p>

<p>May HE who has called us into HIS vineyard, give us the strength, knowledge and wisdom to always stand and work for HIM.</p> AMEN.

<p>1 CORINTHIANS 10:1-13 [THE CHRISTIAN’S LISTENING…]</p>

TO LISTEN: We’re using the Israelites journey as a case study of listening.<br>
1.  Understand that you’re a follower of CHRIST, none other. (Numbers 12:1-15—Speaking against Moses – Representatives of GOD on Earth)<br>
2.  You have been baptized into HIM and must strive to live like HE did, for we’re now dead to sin, and alive in HIM. (:2)<br>
3.  You must be able to dine with HIM, align yourself right, no matter what. (:3-4)<br>
4.  HE is a HOLY, JEALOUS, ALL-POWERFUL and JUST GOD, HE wouldn’t spare you when you fault. (:5 – Numbers 14:29,30)<br>
a.  Desiring Evil Things: Things HE hasn’t given you. (Numbers 11:14)<br>
b.  Idol worship: could be anything that takes your attention from GOD. (Exodus 32:6)<br>
c.  Sexual Immorality: The current strong hold of Satan.<br>
d.  Complaints lead to speaking against. (Numbers 21:5-6)<br>
These things show that we’re not listening…<br>
5.  Read The Bible to know HIS will, for ignorance of the Law is no excuse.<br>
6.  Never regard yourself as high/perfect/complete, rather be on guard always, continuously striving to hear and listen more.<br>
7.  When HE speaks, HE tests to weigh your level of obedience/listening… (1 Corinthians 10:13)<br>

These things show that we’re listening…<br>


<p>LUKE 13:1-9 [THE LORD AND WHAT HE SAYS]</p>
THE LORD:
This scripture reading makes us understand that The LORD is JESUS The CHRIST.<br>

WHAT DOES HE SAY:<br>
(:1 - :5)
HE is always calling us to desist from sin, that is one thing HE is always saying:<br>
a.  See the way people of the world die, car accidents, diseases and all sorts of evil death, CHRIST says that is not our portion as HIS followers!
HE knows our hearts and we can never deceive HIM in any way.
The only reason why we’ve not died like the others is because of HIS Grace that is abundant upon our heads as HIS children.<br>
b.  Such deaths are useless deaths that yields no benefits, unlike dying for your faith in CHRIST, where you’ll be rewarded afterwards. Once you’re hearing, you’ll know if a particular suffering or even death, is HIS Will for you, and you do so wholeheartedly.<br>

(:6 - :9)
Let’s understand that if we’ve decided to live as Christians, then we’ve accepted to live for HIS purpose.
Whatever it is that HE speaks about, is to bring HIM glory, and we should find delight and joy in obeying to glorify HIM, for it is through that, that we are also glorified.<br>
We must strive to be productive to the Kingdom HE has accepted us into, otherwise what is our benefit to HIM.<br>

<p>That is what HE says, use your life to portray and serve HIS purpose in all aspects.<br>
Bring HIM glory, and by so doing continue to enjoy from HIM.</p>

AMEN.<br>
PRAY.<br>
